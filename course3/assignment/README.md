The file run_analysis.R contains all required code to run this assignment.

The included functions are:
**init**(): initializes the required libraries by installing them if required and loading them
**setDataFiles**(): sets the temp directory and downloads the assignment data file
**execute**(): main function that performs sequentially all 5 steps of the assignment

It also contains 2 utility functions (loadFile, joinAll) as helpers to these functions.

And, at last, the call to run the whole thing.. should you want to run it... :-)
Enjoy!
